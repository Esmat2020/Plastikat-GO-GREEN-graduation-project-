# 1.1 Introduction
Recently plastic became one of the most popular materials used in a wide variety of ways since it is lightweight, durable, inexpensive, and flexible where this flexibility makes it possible to be molded, extruded, or even pressed into solid objects of various shapes. This adaptability has led to its widespread use.
In developed economies, about a third of plastic is used in packaging and roughly the same in buildings in applications such as piping, plumbing, and vinyl siding. Other uses include automobiles, furniture, and toys. In the medical field, polymer implants and other medical devices are derived at least partially from plastic.
Although it seems to be useful for us, it can cause serious pollution problems. The problem is that plastic gets discarded easily and it lasts for long periods where it causes great harm. So, we try to help our society by creating an application to collect plastic easily as soon as the user uses his product.
# 1.2 Problem Statement
The main problem is that the field of plastic collecting and recycling in Egypt is suffering, as a number of exploiters dominate this field who sell used plastic as raw materials to foreign companies at a cheap price, and then import companies buy plastic products at high prices after they have been re-manufactured abroad.

If we can help liberate the field of plastic collection and recycling from the hands of those exploiters and keep this process in Egypt, we will contribute to reducing the price of these products, supporting the economy and providing job opportunities for young people.

Through our application we try to discover a way to overcome these obstacles and help our users in the safe disposal of their plastic and help in the recycling process. Also, our application should help the companies concerned with recycling plastic to collect the plastic in an easy safe way to have a more green world.
# 1.3 Project Stakeholders

Shareholder
The shareholders are the owners of Plastikat and the highest rank in the system. Their main concern is to help create a market for recycling the plastic waste locally in Egypt. They can monitor the process of trading the plastic and every user involved in it.


Collector Company
The collector companies are the companies interested in collecting the plastic from the clients. They might be collecting the plastic to protect the environment and the streets from the pollution that comes from the plastic or to recycle it themselves. Due to the lack of companies in that field, the shareholders will be able to create a company in their name to collect the plastic themselves in the beginning.


Partner
The partners are companies where the clients can redeem his points that he earned trading plastic. The partners are in contract with the shareholders to provide the clients with goods in exchange for their points.


Delegate
The delegates are employees who work in the collector companies to confirm and collect the plastic from the clients at the meeting point.


Client 
The clients are the common people. Through Plastikat , they should be able to trade their plastic with points that they will be able to redeem at any branch of any partner company in the system.
# 1.4 Project Scope
Our scope concerns directly connecting plastic collectors with plastic consumers to facilitate the way of recycling or collecting these plastic products. We may face many challenges on how to make the user or plastic consumer like to use our application.
We are trying to make the application like a game full of prizes and rewards in exchange for trading plastic after usage through our application.
We called our application Plastikat to make it more related to our concerns, we are also trying to make the application easy to use and we are doing our best to put in our consideration user experience.
# 1.5 Data Mining Tools
Jupyter Notebook is a community run project with a goal to "develop open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages".

R Studio The technology to amass data exceeds our abilities to make use of it. RStudio helps the world make sense of data, regardless of ability to pay. RStudio's primary purpose is to create free and open-source software for data science, scientific research, and technical communication.

Tableau is a leading data visualization tool used for data analysis and business intelligence. Gartner's Magic Quadrant classified Tableau as a leader for analytics and business intelligence

Prezi is a multimedia presentation tool that can be used as an alternative to traditional slide making programs. Instead of slides, Prezi makes use of one large canvas that allows for panning and zooming to various parts of the canvas to emphasize the ideas presented there.
# 1.6 Analysis and Machine Learning
- R 
- Python
- Tableau
- Machine learning algorithms.
- Predict the plastics quantity in each governorate by applying
- Decision Tree Regressor.
- Multiple Linear Regression.
- Classification model to classify the offers to be accepted or rejected using
- Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Knn and Decision Tree Classifier.
- KMeans Clustering to cluster users, companies per governorate.
